# Personality Test Results Processor

This project created a results processor for a personality test known as the Keirsey Temperament Sorter. The program prompts the user for the name of an input file containing the personality test results and the name of an output file in which to write the processed results. The program then writes the processed results to the output file.

The user may enter in the file names like this:
![Sample console output](https://github.com/leeway64/Personality-Test-Results-Processor/blob/main/Examples/Sample%20Console%20Output.jpg)

The input file is in the format as shown:
![Sample input file](https://github.com/leeway64/Personality-Test-Results-Processor/blob/main/Examples/Sample%20Input%20File.jpg)

Each test response (A or B) corresponds to one dimension of someone's personality. These dimensions are:

"• Extrovert versus Introvert (E vs I): what energizes you

• Sensation versus iNtuition (S vs N): what you focus on

• Thinking versus Feeling (T vs F): how you interpret what you focus on

• Judging versus Perceiving (J vs P): how you approach life"

(from the original assignment specifications)

The final 4 personality results in the output file correspond to 1 letter for each dimension.

The output file should be in this format:

I would like to give credit to the UWS CSE 142 summer 2020 course website for providing the specifications for this project. For more information on this project, the original assignment specifications can be found here: [CSE 142 HW page](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse142/20su/homework.html#a7). The original assignment was meant to be written in Java, but I completed the assignment using C.
